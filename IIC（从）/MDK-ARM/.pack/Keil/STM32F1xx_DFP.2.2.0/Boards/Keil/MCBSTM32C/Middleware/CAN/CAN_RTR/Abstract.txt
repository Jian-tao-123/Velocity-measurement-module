This is an CAN example that demonstrates Remote Transmission Request (RTR) usage.
There are 2 targets available, one is used for device acting as Consumer meaning
it periodically sends RTR and receives data response, other target is used for
device acting as Producer meaning it receives RTR and transmits data response.
This example requires 2 boards to show it's functionality. One device should be
programmed as Consumer the other as Producer and then they should be connected
through CAN bus to see example functionality.

Board:                  Keil     'MCBSTM32C'
Microcontroller:        STM      'STM32F107'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =  25 MHz
                        CPUCLK     =  72 MHz
                        APB1CLK    =  36 MHz (used for CAN controller)
CAN:                    CAN1 at 125 kbit/s
User Interface:         input:  none
                        output: Graphic LCD

The program is available for target(s):
- targets download to and execute from internal Flash

  - STM32F107 - Consumer: It transmits RTR periodically and receives data response
  - STM32F107 - Producer: It receives RTR and transmits data response
